DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/vector_addition.cpp
   src/vector_addition_BAD.cpp
   
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./loop_pipeline <vector_addition XCLBIN>

DETAILS
-------

This example demonstrates how loop pipelining can be used to improve the
performance of a kernel. Pipelining is a technique to increase
instruction level parallelism in the hardware implementation of an
algorithm by overlapping independent stages of operations and functions.

Two kernels ``kernel_vadd`` and ``kernel_pipelined`` are used for
comparison in performance. Kernel execution time will be less for the
pipelined kernel as it uses ``pragma HLS PIPELINE`` in read and write
loops which enables ``burst transfers`` resulting in effective usage of
bandwidth of ``m_axi`` in interface.

.. code:: cpp

   read_a:
           for (int x = 0; x < N; ++x) {
              #pragma HLS LOOP_TRIPCOUNT min=c_n max=c_n
              #pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1
               result[x] = a[i * N + x];
           }

Following is the log reported while running the design on U250 platform:
