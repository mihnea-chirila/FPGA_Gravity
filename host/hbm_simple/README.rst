HBM Simple
==========

This is a simple example of vector addition to describe how to use HLS kernels with HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for achieving high throughput.

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/krnl_vadd.cpp
   
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./hbm_simple <krnl_vadd XCLBIN>

DETAILS
-------

This is Simple example to demonstrate how to use HBM Platform. Two cases
are executed, Single HBM Pseudo-Channel(PC) is used for two inputs and one output;
three separate PCs are used for each argument of kernels. Individual
PC for each buffer will provide more bandwidth for the application.

``cl_mem_ext_ptr`` object needs to be used in cases where memory
assignment is done by user.

.. code:: cpp

   cl_mem_ext_ptr_t bufExt;
   bufExt.obj = source_in1.data();
   bufExt.param = 0;
   bufExt.flags = n | XCL_MEM_TOPOLOGY; // specify n the PC number which needs to be targeted (0:31)
   cl::Buffer buffer_input1(context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY | CL_MEM_EXT_PTR_XILINX | CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR,
                             sizeof(uint32_t) * size, &bufExt, &err));

compute unit interfaces are associated to fixed HBM PCs using
``krnl_vadd.cfg`` file:

::

   [connectivity]
   sp=krnl_vadd_1.in1:HBM[0:3]
   sp=krnl_vadd_1.in2:HBM[0:3]
   sp=krnl_vadd_1.out_r:HBM[0:3]

It specify that kernel interfaces (in1,in2 and out_r) should be
connected such a way that it should have access to HBM PCs 0 to 3.
System linker will make sure this requirement while building the design.

For Case1, all three buffers (in1,in2, and out_r) will be created inside
Single bank and application will run and performance will be reported.
For Case2, All three buffers will be created into different banks and
application will run and performance will be reported. For Case2, three
different banks will give higher DDR bandwidth compare to case1, so
performance of Case2 will be better compare to case1. Following is the
real log reported while running on U280 platform:

::

   Running CASE 1  : Single HBM PC for all three Buffers 
   Each buffer is connected to same HBM PC.
   input 1 -> PC 0 
   input 2 -> PC 0 
   output  -> PC 0 
   [CASE 1] THROUGHPUT = 8.0181 GB/s
   Running CASE 2: Three Separate PCs for Three Buffers
   Each buffer is allocated with different HBM PC.
   input 1 -> PC 1 
   input 2 -> PC 2 
   output  -> PC 3 
   [CASE 2] THROUGHPUT = 24.4078 GB/s 
   TEST PASSED

When building the hardware target, we have used the trace_memory option 
to specify that trace data should be captured in ``HBM[0]`` memory. 

.. code:: cpp

   VPP_LDFLAGS += --profile.trace_memory HBM[0]

The size of the buffer to allocate in memory for trace is captured in xrt.ini
using ``trace_buffer_size``. The trace_buffer_size switch only has an effect
if data_transfer_trace is off. Following is the content of xrt.ini file : 

::

   [Debug]
   opencl_summary=true
   opencl_device_counter=true
   opencl_trace=true
   trace_buffer_size=2M
